ff-autoredirect
===

Version 0.1

Saves a mouseclick when being redirected through captive exit portals - automatically follows the egress link of certain sites. In the future, this will be configurable with a list of sites and regular expressions to match the egress links, but for now it just works for steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/ links.

[] Whitelist instead of just a single URL...
[] More elegantly redirect the tab (instead of waiting for it to load)...
